    \begin{question}
        Consider the population regression testing the relationship whether college GPA is affected by hours of studying. $\text{GPA}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Study}_i + \delta \bfX_i + \epsilon_i$. $\bfX$ refers to other controls in the regression. Upon estimation in the data, the $95\%$ confidence interval corresponding to $\beta_1$ is $(0.012,0.024)$. Assume you have $200$ degrees of freedom ($(n-k-1)=200$).
            \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*),itemsep=1pt,topsep=3pt]
                \item Can you reject the null hypothesis of $\beta_1 = 0$ at the $5\%$ level of significance in a $2$-sided test? What about the null hypothesis $\beta_1 = 0.02$ in a $2$-sided test? Justify your reasoning.
                    {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                        Since $\beta_1 = 0$ is not within the interval $(0.012,0.024)$, we reject the null-hypothesis. Since $\beta_2 = 0.02$ is within the interval $(0.012,0.024)$, we fail to reject the null-hypothesis.
                    \end{solution}}

                \item Can you reject the null hypothesis of $\beta_1 = 0$ at the $1\%$ level significance in a $2$-sided test? What about the null hypothesis of $\beta_1 = 0$ at the $10\%$ level of significance in a $1$-sided test? Justify your reasoning and show any steps.
                    {\color{blue} \begin{solution}

    \begin{question}
        Consider the population regression testing the relationship whether college GPA is affected by hours of studying. $\text{GPA}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Study}_i + \delta \bfX_i + \epsilon_i$. $\bfX$ refers to other controls in the regression. Upon estimation in the data, $\widehat{\beta_1} = 0.025$ and the accompanying standard error is $\text{SE}(\widehat{\beta_1}) = 0.013$. Assume you have 200 degrees of freedom.
            \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*),itemsep=1pt,topsep=3pt]
                \item Can you reject the null hypothesis of $\beta_1 = 0$ in a two-sided test at the 10 percent level of significance?
                    {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                        Our $t$-value is:
                            \begin{equation*}
                            \begin{split}
                                t_k = \frac{\widehat{\beta_1}}{\text{SE}(\widehat{\beta_1})} = \frac{0.025}{0.013} \approx 1.923
                            \end{split}
                            \end{equation*}
                        The critical value for a two-sided test with a $10\%$ level of significance is $t_c \approx 1.652$. Since $t_k > t_c$, we reject the null-hypothesis.
                    \end{solution}}

                \item Given the estimated coefficient and standard error, what is the minimum level of Type-1 error with which you can reject the null of $\beta_1 = 0$ in a two-sided test? What would be your answer if you were considering a one-sided test? (The alternate hypothesis being $\beta_1 > 0$) Your answer in both instances should be a probability.
                    {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                        We can use $t_k$ from part (a). For a two-sided test, we have that $2P(T >|t_k|) \approx 0.056$, so the minimum level of Type-1 error is $5.6\%$. For a one-sided test, we have $P(T > t_k) \approx 0.028$, so the minimum level of Type-1 error is $2.8\%$.
                    \end{solution}}

                \item Can you reject the null hypothesis of $\beta_1 = 0.04$ at the 10 percent level in a two-sided test? What about a one-sided test? Show your steps.
                    {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                        Our $t$-value is:
                            \begin{equation*}
                            \begin{split}
                                t_k = \frac{\widehat{\beta_1} - \beta_1}{\text{SE}(\widehat{\beta_1})} = \frac{0.025 - 0.04}{0.013} \approx -1.154
                            \end{split}
                            \end{equation*}
                        Using $t_c$ from part (a), since $|t_k| \not >  t_c$, we fail to reject the null-hypothesis. For a one-sided test, $t_c \approx 2.345$. Since $|t_k| > t_c$, we reject the null-hypothesis.
                    \end{solution}}

    \begin{question}
        Use \textit{hw4data} for the following question. The data refers to manufacturing firms. A list of variable definitions are provided at the end of the problem set. Consider the population regression function:
            \begin{equation*}
            \begin{split}
                \ln(\text{Output}_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 &\ln(\text{Wages}_i) + \beta_2 \ln(\text{Capital}_i) + \beta_3 \ln(\text{Materials}_i) \\
                & + \beta_4 \text{Importer}_i + \beta_5 \text{Rural}_i + \beta_6 \text{Listed}_i + \beta_7 \text{Age}_i + \beta_8 \text{Age}^2_i + \epsilon_i
            \end{split}
            \end{equation*} 
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*),itemsep=1pt,topsep=3pt]
            \item How much additional output can a firm currently aged 5 years expect when it reaches the age of 10 years. How much additional output can a firm currently aged 50 years expect when it reaches the age of 55 years? (Note: you will first need to compute the natural log of output, wages paid, capital, and materials, and also generate the squared age variable).
                {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                    From the regression, we found that $\widehat{\beta_7} = -0.0108897$ and $\widehat{\beta_8} = 0.0001206$. So we have:
                        \begin{equation*}
                        \begin{split}
                            \Delta \widehat{\ln(\text{Output})_i} &= \bigl(\widehat{\beta_7}\cdot10 + \widehat{\beta_8}\cdot 10^2 \bigr) - \bigl(\widehat{\beta_7}\cdot5 + \widehat{\beta_8}\cdot 5^2 \bigr) = -.04540269,\\
                            \Delta \widehat{\ln(\text{Output})_i} &= \bigl(\widehat{\beta_7}\cdot55 + \widehat{\beta_8}\cdot 55^2 \bigr) - \bigl(\widehat{\beta_7}\cdot50 + \widehat{\beta_8}\cdot 50^2 \bigr) = .00887165.
                        \end{split}
                        \end{equation*}
                \end{solution}}

            \item Based on your regression estimates, from what point can firm owners expect output to display an increasing relationship with age?
                {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                    Consider:
                        \begin{equation*}
                        \begin{split}
                            \frac{\partial \ln(\widehat{\text{Output}_i})}{\partial \text{Age}_i} = \beta_7 + 2\beta_8 \text{Age}_i = 0
                        \end{split}
                        \end{equation*}
                        Solving for $\text{Age}_i$ gives:
                            \begin{equation*}
                            \begin{split}
                                \text{Age}_i = -\frac{\beta_7}{2\beta_8}
                            \end{split}
                            \end{equation*}
                        This will be a local-minimum, whence after age 45 firm owners can expect output to display an increasing relationship with age.
                \end{solution}}

            \item Based on your regression estimates, what will be the minimum Type-1 error you would need to tolerate to reject the null of $\beta_2 = 0.3$ using a two-sided test?
                {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                    Our $t$-value is:
                        \begin{equation*}
                        \begin{split}
                            t_{\widehat{\beta_2}} = \frac{\widehat{\beta_2} - \beta_2}{\text{SE}(\widehat{\beta_2})} = \frac{0.207 - 0.3}{0.006} \approx -15.5
                        \end{split}
                        \end{equation*}
                    The probability that a Type-1 error occurs is basically 0.
                \end{solution}}
            
            \item Based on your regression estimates, can you reject the null of $\beta_6 = -0.1$ at the $5\%$ level using a two-sided test?
                {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                    Our $t$-value is:
                        \begin{equation*}
                        \begin{split}
                            t_{\widehat{\beta_6}} = \frac{\widehat{\beta_6} - \beta_6}{\text{SE}(\widehat{\beta_6})} = \frac{-.0773319 + 0.1}{.0251632} \approx 0.9008
                        \end{split}
                        \end{equation*}
                    At the $5\%$ level, the critical value is $t_c = 1.96$. Thus we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
                \end{solution}}

            \item Based on your regression estimates, test the null hypothesis of $\beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3 = 1$. Can you reject the null hypothesis at the $5\%$ level of significance using a two-sided test? What about the $1\%$ level of significance?
                {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                    Using the \textit{test} command in Stata gave $\text{Prob} > F = 0.0144$. So at the $5\%$ level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis. For the $1\%$ level of significance, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
                \end{solution}}
            
            \item Use an $F$-test to argue whether $\text{Age}_i$ and $\text{Age}_i^2$ should be a part of the population regression function.
                {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                    The value Stata reported is very small. This means $\text{Age}_i$ and $\text{{Age}}_i^2$ are jointly statistically significant and should be included in the model.
                \end{solution}}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{question}
