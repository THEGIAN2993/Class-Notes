\begin{question}
    We will test the hypothesis of whether married women earn more or less on the labour market.
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*),itemsep=1pt,topsep=3pt]
        \item Estimate the following fully saturated regression specification:
            \begin{equation*}
            \begin{split}
                \text{Wage}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Married}_i + \beta_2 \text{Female}_i + \beta_3 (\text{Female}_i\cdot \text{Married}_i) + \epsilon_i. 
            \end{split}
            \end{equation*}
        Use your Stata estimates to interpret $\beta_0$ and $\beta_3$.
            {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                Running the regression gives:
                \begin{Verbatim}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          wage | Coefficient  Std. err.      t    P>|t|     [95% conf. interval]
---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------
       married |   42988.52   1347.147    31.91   0.000      40348.1    45628.94
        female |  -12441.77   1507.421    -8.25   0.000    -15396.33   -9487.216
married_female |  -32428.07   1911.748   -16.96   0.000     -36175.1   -28681.03

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    
                \end{Verbatim}
                $\widehat{\beta_0}$ is the average wage of single men. $\widehat{\beta_3}$ is how much the effect of marriage for women differs from the effect of marriage for men.
            \end{solution}}

        \item An important omitted variable is the time worked by an individual. Define $\text{WkWork}_i$ as weeks worked in the year. Discuss how the estimate of $\beta_1$ would change if you include $\text{WkWork}_i$ in your estimation in $(a)$. Consider the two cases: one where $\text{Corr}(\text{Married}_i, \text{WkWork}_i) > 0$ in the same, and second where $\text{Corr}(\text{Married}_i, \text{WkWork}_i) < 0$. Discuss how the estimated $\beta_1$ would change in each case.
            {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                If there is a positive correlation, omitting $\text{WkWork}_i$ biases $\beta_1$ upward. Adding $\text{WkWork}_i$ to the regression will reduce the estimated marriage effect. If there is a negative correlation, omitting $\text{WkWork}_i$ biases $\beta_1$ downward. Adding $\text{WkWork}_i$ will increase the estimated marriage effect.
            \end{solution}}

        \item Now estimate this in the data by included weeks worked in your estimation (wkswork1). Would you say the estimate of $\beta_1$ in (a) was biased upwards, or downwards? What does this mean about the sign of $\text{Corr}(\text{Married}_i, \text{WkWork}_i)$? Verify this in the data.
            {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                Running the regression gives:
                \begin{Verbatim}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          wage | Coefficient  Std. err.      t    P>|t|     [95% conf. interval]

      wkswork1 |   1904.327   36.28418    52.48   0.000      1833.21    1975.444

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                
                \end{Verbatim}
                So part (a) was biased upwards. This also means $\text{Corr}(\text{Married}_i, \text{WkWork}_i) > 0$.
            \end{solution}}

        \item A second omitted variable is whether the worker has a college degree or not. How do the $\beta_2$ and $\beta_3$ coefficients change upon including this variable? Use your regression coefficients and the omitted variable bias formula to infer whether women in the labor market are more likely to have a college degree.
            {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                
            \end{solution}}

        \item Expand your set of covariates to include the workers gender (female), age (age), and age-squared (sq\_age). Also add in controls for worker location, geography, and industry. You can use the global macros for this. Report and interpret the coefficient estimates for each of $\widehat{\beta_1}$, $\widehat{\beta_2}$, and $\widehat{\beta_3}$
            {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                Running the regressions gives:

                \end{Verbatim}     
                For $\beta_1$: holding all other variables constant, a married man earns about \$30,408 more per year than a comparable single man. For $\beta_2$: holding all else constant, a single woman earns about \$19,938 less per year than a comparable single man. For $\beta_3$: holding all else constant, the wage effect of marriage for women is \$26,238 lower than the wage effect of marriage for men.
            \end{solution}}

        
        \item Use the \textit{test} command to Stata to test the following null hypothesis: $H_0: \beta_1 + \beta_3 = 0$. Can you reject the null at the $1\%$ level? What information is conveyed by $\beta_1 + \beta_3$?
            {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                Using the test command gave:
                \begin{Verbatim}
                    ( 1)  married + married_female = 0

                    F(  1, 56417) =    9.95
                            Prob > F =    0.0016             
                \end{Verbatim}
            Since the $p$-value is below 0.01, we can reject the null hypothesis. $\beta_1 + \beta_3$ gives the overall effect of marriage for women.
            \end{solution}}
        
        \item Now re-estimate the same regression, but after taking the natural log of the outcome variable. Based on your results, is there a gap in earnings for married females, relative to married males?
            {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                Running the regression gives:

            There is a large gap in earning for married females relative to married males. 
            \end{solution}}
        
        \item Estimate the following regression:
            \begin{equation*}
            \begin{split}
                \ln\text{Wage}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Female}_i + \beta_2 \text{Age}_i + \beta_3 \text{Married}_i + \beta_4 (\text{Age}_i \cdot \text{Married}_i) + \beta_5 (\text{Age}_i \cdot \text{Female}_i)+ \delta X_i + \epsilon_i.
            \end{split}
            \end{equation*}
        In (g) include all the controls from (d), as well as College, but exclude age-squared, and the interaction term $\text{Married}_i \cdot \text{Female}_i$. Interpret the $\beta_1$ and $\beta_4$ coefficients. Based on the coefficient estimates for $\beta_4$ and $\beta_5$, are there differential returns for female workers for an additional year of experience (assuming age and experience to be equivalent)?
            {\color{blue} \begin{solution}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
                \end{Verbatim}

                $\beta_1$ shows that a female worker has a wage that is 18.9\% lower than a comparable male. $\beta_4$ shows how the return to an additional year of age changes when a worker is married. Since $\beta_5 < 0$, there are differential returns, as each additional year of experience raises female log wages less than it does for similar males.
            \end{solution}}

        \item Based on the coefficients in (g), how much more would a female worker expect to earn from working 1 additional year? Using the test command in Stata, can you reject the null hypothesis: $H_0:\beta_2 + \beta_4 = 0$ with 95\% confidence?
            {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                Note that $\beta_2 + \beta_5 = 0.0061058$. For an unmarried female, each additional year of experience is associated with about a 0.61\% increase in wages. The \textit{test} command gives:
            \begin{Verbatim}
                    F(  1, 51267) =  182.97
                            Prob > F =    0.0000
            \end{Verbatim}
            \end{solution}}
            Thus we can reject the null hypothesis.

\begin{question}
    We want to assess whether women in the labor force in metropolitan areas are more or less likely to finish college. Consider the fully saturated specification:
        \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            P(\text{College}_i = 1) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Female}_i + \beta_2 \text{Metro}_i + \beta_3 \text{Female}_i \cdot \text{Metro}_i + \epsilon_i.
        \end{split}
        \end{equation*}
    Estimate this in the data to assess whether women in the labor market in metropolitan areas have a higher or lower likelihood of finishing college. What information is provided by the coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_2$?

        $\beta_0$ is the predicted probability that $\text{College}_i = 1$ for men who are not in a metropolitan area. $\beta_2$ is how the predicted probability that $\text{College}_i = 1$ changes if a man instead lives in a metropolitan area.

\begin{question}
    Consider the government thinking about a stimulus plan to boost the economy. A key part of the stimulus plan is to issue checks to households with a high propensity to consume. The government considers testing the hypothesis that families with more children have greater spending propensity. The population regression functions is:
        \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            \ln(\text{Consumption}_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln(\text{Income}_i) 
            &+ \beta_2 \ln(\text{Income}_i)\cdot \text{OneChild}_i \\
            &+ \beta_3 \ln(\text{Income}_i)\cdot \text{TwoChild}_i \\
            &+ \beta_4 \ln(\text{Income}_i)\cdot \text{ThreeChild}_i \\
            &+ \beta_5 \text{OneChild}_i \\
            &+ \beta_5 \text{TwoChild}_i \\
            &+ \beta_5 \text{ThreeChild}_i  + \delta X_i + \epsilon_i.\\
        \end{split}
        \end{equation*}
    $\text{Income}_i$ refers to the annual income of household $i$, and $\text{Consumption}_i$ is the households consumption. OneChild, TwoChild, and ThreeChild are binary variables. Assume the following regression coefficients:
        \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            \widehat{\beta_1} = 0.11, \h5 \text{SE}(\widehat{\beta_1}) = .089 \\
            \widehat{\beta_2} = 0.31, \h5 \text{SE}(\widehat{\beta_2}) = .067 \\
            \widehat{\beta_3} = 0.61, \h5 \text{SE}(\widehat{\beta_3}) = .143 \\
            \widehat{\beta_4} = 0.21, \h5 \text{SE}(\widehat{\beta_4}) = .158 \\
        \end{split}
        \end{equation*}
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*),itemsep=1pt,topsep=3pt]
        \item Do changes in income have a large or small impact on consumption changes for families with no children?
            {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                For every 1\% increase in income, there is a 0.11\% increase in consumption. So income has a very small impact on consumption changes for families with no children.
            \end{solution}}

        \item Interpret the $\beta_2$ coefficient.
            {\color{blue} \begin{solution}
                Having exactly one child increases the consumption-income elasticity by 0.31 relative to households with no children.
            \end{solution}}

        \item Based on the above evidence, as a policymaker, which type of families would you target when considering a stimulus package?
