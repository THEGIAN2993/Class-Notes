    \begin{exercise}
        Let $T \in \Hom_F{(V,W)}$. We get an induced map $T^\vee \in \Hom_F{(W^\vee , V^\vee)}$ such that $T^\vee(\varphi) = \varphi \circ T$ for some $\varphi \in W^\vee$. The following diagram commutes:
                \begin{center}
                    \begin{tikzcd}
                        V \arrow[r, "T"] \arrow[rd, "T^\vee(\varphi)"', dashed] & W \arrow[d, "\varphi"] \\
                                                                                     & F                     
                        \end{tikzcd}
                \end{center}
            Prove that $T^\vee \in \Hom_F{(W^\vee,V^\vee)}$.
            
    \end{exercise}
        \begin{proof}
            Let $\varphi_1,\varphi_2 \in W^\vee$ and $\alpha \in F$. Then 
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    T^\vee(\varphi_1 + \alpha \varphi_2)(v)
                    & = (\varphi_1 + \alpha \varphi_2)(T(v)) \\
                    & = \varphi_1(T(v)) + \alpha (\varphi_2(T(v)))\\
                    & = T^\vee(\varphi_1)(v) + \alpha T^\vee(\varphi_2)(v) \\
                    & = (T^\vee(\varphi_1) + \alpha T^\vee(\varphi_2))(v).
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Thus $T^\vee$ is a linear map.
        \end{proof}

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $T \in \Hom_F{(P_7(F),P_7(F))}$ be defined by $T(f(x)) = f'(x)$, where $f'(x)$ denotes the usual derivative of a polynomial $f(x) \in P_7(F)$. For each of the fields below, determine a basis for the image and kernel of $T$:
            \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
                \item $F = \bfR$.
                \item $F = \bfF_3$.
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{exercise}
        \begin{proof}
            Let $F = \bfR$. Observe that:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    T(a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4 + a_5 x^5  + a_6 x^6 + a_7 x^7) &= a_1  + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + 4a_4 x^3 + 5a_5 x^4  + 6a_6 x^5 + 7a_7 x^6 \\
                    T(a_0) &= 0.
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            So a basis for $\Image{(T)}$ is $\{1,x,x^2,x^3,x^4,x^5,x^6 \}$ and a basis for $\ker{(T)}$ is $\{1\}$.

            Now let $F = \bfF_3$. Observe that:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    T(\overline{a_0} + \overline{a_1} x + \overline{a_2} x^2 + \overline{a_3} x^3 + \overline{a_4} x^4 + \overline{a_5} x^5  + \overline{a_6} x^6 + \overline{a_7} x^7) &= \overline{a_1} + \overline{2 a_2} x + \overline{a_4} x^3 + \overline{2a_5} x^4 + \overline{a_7}x^6\\
                    T(\overline{a_0} + \overline{a_1}x^3 + \overline{a_2}x^6) = \overline{0}.
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
                So a basis for $\Image{(T)}$ is $\{1,x,x^3,x^4,x^6\}$ and a basis for $\ker{(T)}$ is $\{1,x^3,x^6\}$.
        \end{proof}

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $T \in \Hom_F{(V,F)}$. Prove that if $v \in V$ is not in $\ker{(T)}$, then
            \begin{equation*}
            \begin{split}
                V = \ker{(T)} \oplus \{cv \mid c \in F\}.
            \end{split}
            \end{equation*}
    \end{exercise}
        \begin{proof}
            Let $I = \{cv \mid c \in F\}$, we must first show that it is a subspace of $V$. Let $av, bv \in I$ and $c \in F$. Note that $I$ is nonempty because $0v = 0 \in I$. Let $av,bv \in I$ and $c \in F$. Then $av + c(bv) = av + (cb)v = (a+cb)v \in I$.

            Let $x+y \in \ker{(T)} + I$. Since $\ker{(T)}$ and $I$ are subspaces, $x + y \in V$. Now let $w \in V$. If $w \in \ker{(T)}$, then we are done (because $w = w + 0v \in \ker{(T)} + I$). Suppose $w \not\in \ker{(T)}$. Then $T(w) = \alpha$ for some $\alpha \in F, \alpha \neq 0$, which is equivalent to $\alpha^{-1}T(w) = 1$. Since $v \not\in \ker{(T)}$, suppose $T(v) = \beta$ for some $\beta \in F, \beta \neq 0$. It follows that $\alpha^{-1}T(w) = \beta^{-1}T(v)$. Simplifying yields $T(w - \alpha \beta^{-1}v) = 0$, giving $w - \alpha \beta^{-1}v = k$ for some $k \in \ker{(T)}$. Thus $w = k + \alpha \beta^{-1} v \in \ker{(T)} + I$, establishing $V = \ker{(T)} + I$.

            We now need to show that $\ker{(T)}$ and $I$ are independent. Let $k+\alpha \beta^{-1}v = k+cv = 0$. Then $T(k+cv) = T(cv) = cT(v) = 0$. But since $v \not\in \ker{(T)}$, we must have that $c = 0$; i.e., $cv = 0$. Then $k+cv = k = 0$. Since $\ker{(T)}$ and $I$ are independent, $V = \ker{(T)} \oplus I$.
        \end{proof}

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $W$ be a subspace of a finite dimensional vector space $V$. Let $T \in \Hom_F{(V,V)}$ so that $T(W) \subset W$. Show that $T$ induces a linear transformation $\overline{T} \in \Hom_F{(V/W,V/W)}$. Prove that $T$ is nonsingular (i.e., injective) on $V$ if and only if $T$ is restricted to $W$ and $\overline{T}$ on $V/W$ are both nonsingular.
    \end{exercise}
        \begin{proof}
            Define $\overline{T}: V/W \rightarrow V/W$ by $v +W \mapsto T(v) + W$. We must first show that $\overline{T}$ is well-defined. Suppose $v_1 + W = v_2 + W$, then $v_1 = v_2 + w$ for some $w \in W$. Observe that:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    \overline{T}(v_1 + W)
                    & = T(v_1) + W \\
                    & = T(v_2 + w) + W \\
                    & = T(v_2) + T(w) + W \hspace{15pt} \text{\tiny Since $T \in \Hom_F{(V,V)}$}\\
                    & = T(v_2) + W \hspace{53pt} \text{\tiny Since $T(W) \subset W$} \\
                    & = \overline{T}(v_2 + W).
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Let $v_1 + W , v_2 + W \in V/W$, and $\alpha \in F$. Then:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    \overline{T}((v_1 + W) + \alpha(v_2 + W))
                    & = \overline{T}((v_1 + W) + (\alpha v_2 + W)) \\
                    & = \overline{T}((v_1 + \alpha v_2) + W) \\
                    & = T(v_1 + \alpha v_2) + W \\
                    & = T(v_1) + \alpha T(v_2) + W \\
                    & = (T(v_1) + W) + \alpha(T(v_2) + W) \\
                    & = \overline{T}(v_1 + W) + \alpha \overline{T}(v_2 + W),
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            hence $\overline{T} \in \Hom_F{(V/W, V/W)}$. Now consider the maps $V \xrightarrow{T} V \xrightarrow{\pi} V/W$, where $\pi:V \rightarrow V/W$ is the canonical projection map. It can be proved that $\pi \circ T = \overline{T} \circ \pi$ as follows: let $v \in V$ and observe that $\pi(T(v)) = T(v) + W$, which is equivalent to $\overline{T}(\pi(v)) = \overline{T}(v + W) = T(v) + W$. We've established that the following diagram commutes:
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}
                    V \arrow[d, "\pi"'] \arrow[r, "T"] & V \arrow[d, "\pi"] \\
                    V/W \arrow[r, "\overline{T}"']     & V/W \hspace{4pt}.              
                    \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}
            
            Let $T$ be injective. Since $T$ is finite dimensional, it must be bijective. Clearly $T\mid_W:W \rightarrow V$ is injective by inclusion. Let $v+W \in \ker{(\overline{T})}$. Then $\overline{T}(v+W) = T(v)+W = 0+W$. This gives that $T(v) \in W$, and from the fact that $T$ is bijective, $T(W) = W$, giving $v \in W$. Hence $v+W = 0+W$.

            Conversely, suppose $T\mid_W$ and $\overline{T}$ are injective. Let $v \in \ker{(T)}$. Then $T(v) = 0$ is equivalent to $\pi(T(v)) = 0 + W$. Using the fact that the above diagram commutes, we can write $\overline{T}(\pi(v)) = 0 + W$. Since $\overline{T}$ is injective, its kernel is trivial, hence it must be the case that $\pi(v) = 0 +W$. Thus $v \in W$, hence $T(v) = T\mid_W (v) = 0$, establishing that $v= 0$. Thus $T$ is injective.
        \end{proof}
