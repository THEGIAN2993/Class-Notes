        Let $V$ be an $F$-vector space.
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
            \item Prove that an arbitrary intersection of subspaces of $V$ is again a subspace of $V$
            \item Prove that the union of two subspaces of $V$ is a subspace of $V$ if and only if one of the subspaces is contained in the other.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{exercise}
        \begin{proof}
            Let $\{W_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an arbitrary collection of subspaces of $V$. Let $x,y \in \bigcap_{i \in I}W_i$ and $\alpha \in F$. Then $x,y \in W_i$ for all $i$. Hence $x+\alpha y \in W_i$ for all $i$ which gives $x+\alpha y \in \bigcap_{i \in I}W_i$, establishing (a).

            Let $U,W$ be subspaces of $V$. Let $u,w \in U \cup W$ and $\alpha \in F$. Without loss of generality suppose $U \subseteq W$ with $u \in U$ and $w\in W$. Then it is also the case that $u \in W$, hence $u + \alpha w \in W \subseteq U \cup W$. Conversely, suppose $U \cup W$ is an $F$-subspace of $V$. Assume towards contradiction that $U \not\subseteq W$ and $W \not\subseteq U$. Let $u \in U$,$u \not\in W$ and $w \in W$, $w \not\in U$. Since $U \cup W$ is an $F$-vector space, $u + w \in  U \cup W$. Without loss of generality, let $u + w \in U$, then $(-u) +u + w = w \in U$, a contradiction. Hence $U \subseteq W$ or $W \subseteq U$, establishing (b).

        Let $T \in \Hom_F{(F,F)}$. Prove there exists $\alpha \in F$ so that $T(v) = \alpha v $ for every $v \in F$.
    \end{exercise}
        \begin{proof}
            Let $\beta \in F$, $\beta \neq 0$. Then $\{\beta\}$ forms a basis for $F$ as an $F$-vector space. Let $v \in F$, then $v = \beta v_0$ for some $v_0 \in F$. Observe that:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    T(v)
                    & = T(\beta v_0) \\
                    & = v_0 T(\beta) \\
                    & = v \beta^{-1}T(\beta) \\
                    & = v T(\beta^{-1} \beta) \\
                    & = v T(1).
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            From this, "$\alpha$" is uniquely determined by where $T(1)$ gets mapped to.

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space and $T \in \Hom_F{(V,V)}$ with $T^2 = T$.
            \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
                \item Prove that $\Image{(T)} \cap \ker{(T)} = \{0\}$.
                \item Prove that $V = \Image{(T)} \oplus \ker{(T)}$.
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{exercise}
        \begin{proof}
            Let $v \in \Image{(T)} \cap \ker{(T)}$. Then $v \in \Image{(T)}$ and $v \in \ker{(T)}$. So there exists an element $w \in V$ such that $T(w) = v$, and $T(v) = 0$. Observe that $v = T(w) = T(T(w)) = T(v) = 0$.

            Let $x+y \in \Image{(T)} + \ker{(T)}$. Since $x \in \Image{(T)} \subseteq V$ and $y \in \ker{(T)} \subseteq V$, $x+y \in V$. Now let $v \in V$. Then $T(v) = w$ for some $w \in \Image{(T)}$. Let $k = v - T(w)$. Then $T(k) = T(v - T(w)) = T(v) - T(T(w)) = T(v) - T(v) = 0$, so $k \in \ker{(T)}$. Hence $v = T(w) + k \in \Image{(T)} + \ker{(T)}$, which gives $V = \Image{(T)} + \ker{(T)}$.
            
            We must now show that $\Image{(T)}$ and $\ker{(T)}$ are independent. If $T(w) + k = 0$, then $k = T(-w)$ implies $k \in \Image{(T)}$. So $k \in \Image{(T)} \cap \ker{(T)}$, and by (a) it must be that $k = 0$. Similarly, $T(T(w) + k) = 0$ is equivalent to $T(T(w)) + T(k) = 0$, which simplifies to $T(T(w)) = 0$; i.e., $T(w) \in \ker{(T)}$. So $T(w) \in \Image{(T)} \cap \ker{(T)}$, which gives that $T(w) = 0$. Thus $\Image{(T)}$ and $\ker{(T)}$ are independent, giving $V = \Image{(T)} \oplus \ker{(T)}$.

        \begin{proof}
            Let $v \in \Image{(T)}$. Then there exists a $w \in V$ such that $T(w) = v$. But observe that $T(v) = T(T(w)) = T^2(w) = 0$, hence $v \in \ker{(T)}$ which establishes the containment $\Image{(T)} \subseteq \ker{(T)}$. By the rank-nullity theorem $n = \dim_F{(\Image{(T)})} + \dim_F{(\ker{(T)})}$. If $\Image{(T)} = \ker{(T)}$ then it must be the case that $\dim_F{(\Image{(T)})} = \dim_F{(\ker{(T)})} = n/2$, otherwise (when $\Image{(T)} \subset \ker{(T)}$) $\dim_F{(\Image{(T)})} < n/2$.

    \begin{exercise}
        Let $W$ be a subspace of a finite dimensional vector space $V$. Let $T \in \Hom_F{(V,V)}$ so that $T(W) \subset W$. Show that $T$ induces a linear transformation $\overline{T} \in \Hom_F{(V/W,V/W)}$. Prove that $T$ is nonsingular (i.e., injective) on $V$ if and only if $T$ is restricted to $W$ and $\overline{T}$ on $V/W$ are both nonsingular.
    \end{exercise}
        \begin{proof}
            Define $\overline{T}: V/W \rightarrow V/W$ by $v +W \mapsto T(v) + W$. We must first show that $\overline{T}$ is well-defined. Suppose $v_1 + W = v_2 + W$, then $v_1 = v_2 + w$ for some $w \in W$. Observe that:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    \overline{T}(v_1 + W)
                    & = T(v_1) + W \\
                    & = T(v_2 + w) + W \\
                    & = T(v_2) + T(w) + W \hspace{15pt} \text{\tiny Since $T \in \Hom_F{(V,V)}$}\\
                    & = T(v_2) + W \hspace{53pt} \text{\tiny Since $T(W) \subset W$} \\
                    & = \overline{T}(v_2 + W).
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            Let $v_1 + W , v_2 + W \in V/W$, and $\alpha \in F$. Then:
                \begin{equation*}
                \begin{split}
                    \overline{T}((v_1 + W) + \alpha(v_2 + W))
                    & = \overline{T}((v_1 + W) + (\alpha v_2 + W)) \\
                    & = \overline{T}((v_1 + \alpha v_2) + W) \\
                    & = T(v_1 + \alpha v_2) + W \\
                    & = T(v_1) + \alpha T(v_2) + W \\
                    & = (T(v_1) + W) + \alpha(T(v_2) + W) \\
                    & = \overline{T}(v_1 + W) + \alpha \overline{T}(v_2 + W),
                \end{split}
                \end{equation*}
            hence $\overline{T} \in \Hom_F{(V/W, V/W)}$. Now consider the maps $V \xrightarrow{T} V \xrightarrow{\pi} V/W$, where $\pi:V \rightarrow V/W$ is the projection map. It can be proved that $\pi \circ T = \overline{T} \circ \pi$ as follows: let $v \in V$ and observe that $\pi(T(v)) = T(v) + W$, which is equivalent to $\overline{T}(\pi(v)) = \overline{T}(v + W) = T(v) + W$. We've established that the following diagram commutes:
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}
                    V \arrow[d, "\pi"'] \arrow[r, "T"] & V \arrow[d, "\pi"] \\
                    V/W \arrow[r, "\overline{T}"']     & V/W \hspace{4pt}.              
                    \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}

            
            Now assume $T$ is injective \textemdash by inspection one can see that $T\mid_W : W \rightarrow V$ is injective. Since $\overline{T}$ is defined by $v + W \mapsto T(v)+W$, it must be injective as well. Conversely, let $T\mid_W$ and $\overline{T}$ be injective. Let $v \in V$ with $v \in \ker{(T)}$. Then $T(v) = 0$ is equivalent to $\pi(T(v)) = 0 + W$. Using the fact that the above diagram commutes, we can write $\overline{T}(\pi(v)) = 0 + W$. Since $\overline{T}$ is injective, its kernel is trivial, hence it must be the case that $\pi(v) = 0 +W$. Thus $v \in W$, giving $T\mid_W (v) = 0$. Again, since $T\mid_W$ is injective, its kernel is trivial, establshing that $v= 0$. Thus $T$ is injective.
        \end{proof}
